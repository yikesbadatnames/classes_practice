# classes_practice
Hey all, nothing to see here. Just practicing with classes. 

would be nice to do a data cleaning process for a new data set, do some light visualizations, and then turn the whole thing into a class. 

Potential list

<br></br>

total 311 calls in nyc: 
    * https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9
      * more interesting from a techncial aspect. more columns means for more manipulations in the class.
      * also provides geographical data. 

people who passed the civil servant exam:
  * https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Civil-Service-List-Active-/vx8i-nprf
    * more interesting from a civil servants aspect. see who the top performers are, and where there interests are.

Possible objective:
    * Create a class for the first one, and USE that class to actually analyze the next one. a little ambitous and I would need to stay focus on data transformations. then we can do a lot of stuff in tableau.
